Debug issue executing gameboy rom instruction at $0064

$0064 - LD A ($FF00+$44)
$0066 - CP $90
$0068 - JR NZ, Addr_0064

- It seems like this loop is waiting for LY($FF44) to take
on a certain value. Are we setting LY in the ppu?
- We actually need to coordinate between the ppu and cpu for
this to work -- the right now the lyc is doing the full range
every clock cycle(!). That ain't right.
