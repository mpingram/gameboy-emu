[WIP] Implement CPU instructions

* Implement and document all instructions in:
  ** CPU control commands
  ** Jump commands
  ** 8bit load commands
  ** 16bit load commands

* Add getters/setters to 8bit CPU registers
  ** This helps us write functions that can operate on
    different CPU register

* TODO Remove Executor interface
  ** I realized I was essentially duplicating code for no
    benefit. As far as I can tell it doesn't make a difference
    whether or not we have the Executor interface, and it was only
    adding a level of indirection.

* Move instruction documentation
  ** I made some modifications to the documentation
